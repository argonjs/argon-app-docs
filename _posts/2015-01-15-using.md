# Using Argon4

The Argon4 browser works like any other web browser, displaying web pages and applications you point it at with a URL. When you first run Argon4, it will display the bookmarks page, where a collection of examples are pre-loaded. 
The source code for the bookmarks are all available on our [github site](http://github.com/argonjs).  The bookmarks page displays either bookmarks or your browsing history.

At the top of the page is a URL bar for entering URL's manually.  The "page stack" icon beside it brings up the view of currently open *pages* and *realities*.  New pages can be created here with the + icon in the upper left, and each page can be destroyed with the close icon in its upper left.  Tapping a *page* brings it to the front.

The menu in the upper right allows you to bookmark or reload the current page, switch between different realities (*Select Reality...*)
that developers may have 
created for the pages you are viewing, use *Show Console* to overlay the Javascript console on the current page (most useful 
for developers) and switch between normal viewing and *stereo viewer* mode using *Enable Viewer Mode*.  Viewer mode is used with stero holders for your phone (such as the ubiquitous *Google Cardboard Viewer*) to show the page in a more immersive stereo mode.  A small exit icon on the lower middle of the 
stereo display takes you back to normal view.

The Argon4 UI supports *Pinch Zoom* to allow you to zoom in and out of the
3D AR view.  This capability can be opted out by a developer, if (for example) 
they want to use the gesture for their own application.  Similarly, different
realities may or may not support arbitrary zooming.  

### One set of AR web pages, multiple views of Reality

Argon takes a broad view of Augmented Reality, allowing any *3D view* of reality to be augmented.  Developers are free to create their own custom 
views of reality:  anything that displays a view of the world can conceivably
be built into a reality for Argon.  The samples show an example of this, using
Google's streetview as the view of reality over which any AR content can
be displayed.

Tapping on a reality allows you to interact with that reality; the default *live video* reality does not support any interactions, but others (such as 
the streetview reality in the samples) do support interaction.  In the case of streetview, for example, selecting that reality will allow you to move around the world using streetview, while the content maintains it's position in the world.

### One view of Reality, many AR apps at the Same Time

While Argon4 behaves much like a normal web browser, allowing multiple pages
to be loaded into different tabs, it handles the case of multiple AR 
apps in a special way.  If the front page is a normal web page, it is 
displayed by itself, as any other browser.  But if the front page is 
an AR web page, *all* open AR web pages are displayed at the same time.

When multiple AR web pages are displayed, their content is layered behind
each other (based on their stacking order in the page viewer), rather than
being mixed in 3D.  So all content in the front page will be displayed
in front of all content in the pages behind it.  This was done for safety
and security, so that it is clearer what pages may have created which
content.  Similarly, only the front page receives user input.
